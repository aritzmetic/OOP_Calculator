## **INTRODUCTION**
> _The OOP Calculator is an online calculator developed with an OOP approach. Users may add, subtract, multiply, and divide, among other elementary arithmetic operations. The calculator has a straightforward interface, shows off random bits of information, and has exception handling built in to guarantee accurate results. The OOP Calculator is a command-line calculator made to make complex arithmetic problems easier to solve. It applies OOP principles to implement modularity and ensure the safety of data. The program has five basic parts:_

1. **CalculatorInput** is the part of the calculator that deals with the input from the user, such as selecting an operation and entering numbers.
2. **CalculatorOperations** is the part of the calculator that is responsible for carrying out the calculations based on the information provided by the user.
3. **CalculatorDisplay** is the part of the component that is responsible for displaying messages, actions, and results. It also has some trivia and farewell notes.
4. **OOP_Calculator** is the part of the component where the main from is arranged.
5. Lastly, the main program file, known as **main.py**, which is responsible for initializing an instance of the Calculator class and running the calculator.

### **PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED**
> Python

## **Attributes**
- > The calculator has a **straightforward command-line interface** that is easy to use.
- > Users have **access to the four fundamental mathematical operations**—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- > The calculator has **built-in support for managing a variety of error conditions**, including invalid input and a division by zero.
- > The calculator presents a variety of **bizarre mathematical information** relating to the many operations available.
- > Descriptive messages appear **to show the status of calculations** as they are being processed.
- > The **calculator then displays the calculated value.**
- > The user's input is **checked for correctness before the operation is performed** by the program.
- > Users can choose to **rerun calculations at any time** without having to restart the program.
- > When activated, the **calculator's program addresses the user by name.**
- > When the calculator is closed, it shows a m**athematically-themed quotation at random.**

## **How to run this program using IDE?**
> 1. Create a new directory and store the files main.py, OOP_Calculator.py, calculator_display.py, calculator_operations.py, and calculator_input.py there.
> 2. Launch your IDE of choice and open the main.py file.
> 3. Execute the main.py file by either selecting it and clicking the IDE's "Run" button or typing "python main.py" into the command prompt.
> 4. A prompt asking for your name will appear on screen. Type in your name, then hit the Enter key.
> 5. Just do what it says on the screen, and you may start having fun with Aritzmetic's Calculator right away!
